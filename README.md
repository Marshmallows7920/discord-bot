# discord-bot
An open-source Lua discord bot for wholesome content. Made during a 12 hour hackathon. Inspired by Maya's positive vibes bot.
The main purpose of the bot is to reduce self deprecating comments and add some love in a server. You can trigger the bot's responses from different types of messages or by commands. There is commands for memes, cute pictures and food. Other than the jokes, the bot uses the reddit api for this media. All the content is from heavily moderated and clean sub reddits.

Jokes are from the cleanest dad-joke site i could find ヾ(•ω•`)o
There are some funny easter eggs and more features will regularly be added.

Due to Heroku changing its hosting policy and Reddit limiting it's Api, the bot is only availible for self hosting with limited capabilities.
